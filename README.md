# Read Me - Project Overview
For the final project, I am going to create a flyer for my favorite restaurant in Oakland, JJ Poke. 
As far as baseline project goals I would like to:
- have a clear message 
- use bright and positive colors that are consistent with the brand
- include font and words/saying that are consistent with the brand 
- credit all assets 
- use more than 3 layers
- use QR code 

Aspirational
- use colors that are designed for colorblindness
- use tools I did not previously use

List of Tasks 
- collect images that represent the brand 
- decided on color scheme
